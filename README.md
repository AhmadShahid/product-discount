- **[Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/)** is a testing platform from Facebook Code. It's easy to configure and provides out-of-the-box mocking and code coverage reporting.
- **[Docker](https://docker.com/)** takes away repetitive, mundane configuration tasks and is used throughout the development lifecycle for fast, easy and portable application development
